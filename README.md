# Recipe box

This is a [freecodecamp](https://www.freecodecamp.com/cryder9898) project. You can view a recipe list. You can edit, add and delete recipes and ingredients. This app stores data in local storage so that on a page refresh the recipes will be saved.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). It also showcases [reactstrap](https://reactstrap.github.io/).
